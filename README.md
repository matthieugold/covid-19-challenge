# RECON COVID-19 challenge - Bringing the R community together against COVID-19

We are proud to announce that the [R Consortium](https://www.r-consortium.org/) has awarded RECON a grant for $23,300 to develop the RECON COVID-19 challenge, a project aiming to centralise, organise and manage needs for analytics resources in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) to support the response to COVID-19 worldwide.

These resources will permit to expand our initial preliminary collection of [github issues](https://github.com/reconhub/covid19hub) to create a user-friendly web platform gathering R tasks reflecting needs from different projects and groups, and facilitate contributions from the wider R programming community.

## The RECON COVID-19 challenge in a nutshell

The RECON COVID-19 challenge aims to bring together the infectious disease modelling, epidemiology and R communities to improve analytics resources for the COVID-19 response via a website which will provide a platform to centralise, curate and update R development tasks relevant to the COVID-19 response. Similar to the Open Street Map Tasking Manager ([tasks.hotosm.org](https://tasks.hotosm.org/)), this platform will allow potential contributors to quickly identify outstanding tasks submitted by groups involved in the response to COVID-19 and ensure that developments follow the highest scientific and technical standards.

While this project is aimed at leveraging R tools for helping to respond to COVID-19, we expect that it will lead to long-lasting developments of partnerships between the R and epidemiological communities, and that the resources developed will become key assets for supporting outbreak responses well beyond this pandemic.
