Present: BOU + MR

Agenda:

* Rstudio connect
* domain name
* score
* progress

Done since last time:

* We have Rstudio connect for 12 months
* added the star as filter
* added editable labels

Meeting notes:

* had issues to login thubaut's website, 
* tried again during meeting: not working
* we have access to Rstudio, ben will move there at some point before we go live

To do:

* get domain name to work, write to Thibaut
* add the star as link to github favorite
* add upvote/downvote + score computation + ordering
* re put repo in the task creation (was wrongly removed)
* sync the closing with github
* link person who submitted the task to github issue, they need notification not the reviewer
* matthieu: write site content
