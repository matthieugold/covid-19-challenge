# About

The COVID-19 challenge is an effort to set a direct communication channel between epidemiologists, modellers and R developers to fill existing needs in analysis tools for the response to COVID-19. This will be achieved through the development of a website/platform listing outstanding tasks such as new functionalities, new R packages, shiny interfaces, or code reviews, all relating to the responses to COVID-19.
