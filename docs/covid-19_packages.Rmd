# Covid 19 specific

## Automated search

```{r echo = TRUE}
# list epidemiology packages
cov19 <- pkg_search(query="covid covid19 coronavirus",size=200)
```

```{r}
# filter those with score > 10 and > 500 downloads last month
cov19 <- as_tibble(cov19) %>% 
  filter(score >= 10) %>% 
  select(package,title, downloads_last_month) %>% 
  arrange(-downloads_last_month)

cov19 %>%
  kable(caption = "Covid 19 packages") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
