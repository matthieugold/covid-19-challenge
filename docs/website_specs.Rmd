static website; may use free and / or open-source content management systems (CMS)

* sources of the website should use version control and be hosted on a public repository (ideally git/github)
* provide a user-friendly interface listing existing R-tasks reflecting analytics needs for the response to COVID-19, each task pointing to a github issue; for a (more complex) example, see https://tasks.hotosm.org/explore
* provide a streamlined way (e.g. through google forms) to submit new tasks from existing github issues
* provide a streamlined way (e.g. through google forms) to submit new tasks without existing github issue, creating a new github issue on a dedicated repository on github.com/reconhub
* provide a streamlined way to validate and curate tasks before publishing
* implement priority grading system for tasks
* implement difficulty grading system for tasks
* implement labeling system for tasks
* implement a search engine for tasks
* implement filters for searching tasks
* possibility to vote up and down

Ideas:

* Mobile compatible
* automatic request notification? (twitter? email for those who wish? etc)
* badge system to reward users? (low priority)
